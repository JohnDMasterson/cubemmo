# cubemmo
This is a webGL demo I made for sig-soft. It has an online version running at http://cubemmo.herokuapp.com
For the app to work properly, there must be multiple users on the site (or multiple browser tabs)

Controls:
W/S/A/D for moving forward/backward/left/right
Q/E For rotating Left/Right
